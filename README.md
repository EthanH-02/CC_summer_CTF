# CompClub Summer CTF 2023

The following contents contain the problems, code and layout for the Summer School's CTF, originally based and inspired from teh works of Damjan and Abiram.

Solutions for the workshop can be found within these folders.

Please do not tell the students the answer to the problems instead focus on helping them when stuck, providing guidence and working through each part with them. Also keep in mind scaling your clues, obviously give easier clues to year 7 or year 8 students in comparison to a year 11 or year 12.
